# Project 1, Milestone 2 Feedback

NetID: [sta48]

Milestone 2 is graded for a **completion grade _by section_**. This is a feedback milestone. If you tried to complete it, even though there are some mistakes, you'll get full credit **for that section**. If a section is obviously incomplete, you'll get a 0. **There is no partial credit within a specific section.**

We provide feedback on your milestones to help guide your work for the final submission. Our feedback is designed to help you learn more; our feedback is not a "_pre-grade_". This feedback is designed to catch large problems (which we sometimes miss). **Regardless of the feedback (or lack of feedback) that you get, you are responsible for meeting all of the project's requirements for the final submission.**


**GRADING INSTRUCTIONS:** View the existing website in **Firefox**. View the Design Journey in **Code's Markdown Preview**.


## Planning: Sticky Form
**Target Audience Needs:**
- [x] Purpose of form meets the needs of at least 1 target audience.

- [] Includes sketches or thorough descriptions of form with feedback.
- [] Includes target audience appropriate feedback.
- [] Includes sufficient pseudocode that another 2300 student could implement the validation/feedback of the sticky form..

    (i.e. missing files, no images in markdown preview, etc.)

> Does the student appear to be on track? Are you concerned about their progress?

> Do you have any additional feedback for the student?
