# Project 1, Milestone 1 Feedback

NetID: sta48

Milestone 1 is graded for a **completion grade _by section_**. This is a feedback milestone. If you tried to complete it, even though there are some mistakes, you'll get full credit **for that section**. If a section is obviously incomplete, you'll get a 0. **There is no partial credit within a specific section.**

We provide feedback on your milestones to help guide your work for the final submission. Our feedback is designed to help you learn more; our feedback is not a "_pre-grade_". This feedback is designed to catch large problems (which we sometimes miss). **Regardless of the feedback (or lack of feedback) that you get, you are responsible for meeting all of the project's requirements for the final submission.**

# Project 1, Milestone 1

**GRADING INSTRUCTIONS:** View the existing website in **Firefox**. View the Design Journey in **Code's Markdown Preview**.

## Existing Static Website
- [x] **Existing site: 4-6 HTML files with sufficient content (minimal placeholders).** (This is required for full credit for this section; otherwise 0/3 for this section).
- [x] Only HTML, CSS, and images files (JS is okay for now) were copied to root of repository. No other files were copied (e.g. README.md, submit.md, design-journey.md, etc.)
- [x] No hotlinked resources in existing site; Hotlinking is prohibited in this class.

- [ ] Explains and justifies existing target audience.
- [x] Existing site's needs are specific and representative of target audience.
- [x] The target audience is specific and appropriate for the goals of the website.

- [x] There exist sketches for every page of the existing website.
- [x] Existing sketches are representative of the existing website.

> What did the student do well?

Great base for your project 1! I'm looking forward to seeing how this will evolve! Great styling!

> What needs improvement?

Your original target audience is a bit too broad (the general public). Is there a more targeted audience you could potentially hit? Additionally, make sure to explain how your target audience relates to the goals of your site (i.e: explain why they would be navigating to your site). Additionally, I don't believe js is allowed for this project. onclick (in the buttons) is a js function call. You can work around this by making buttons clickable links.

**Existing Static Site 3 / 3 points** _(no partial credit)_


## Refined Dynamic Website
- [ ] Explains and justifies the secondary target audience.
- [x] Needs are specific and representative of the secondary target audience.
- [x] The secondary target audience is specific and appropriate for the goals of the website.

- [x] Design of content organization and navigation documented with several iterations of card sorting: 1) 1st audience, 2) 2nd audience, 3) both audiences.
- [x] Refined website sketches meet the needs of both target audiences.
- [x] Design is aesthetically pleasing and employs visual design principles.
- [ ] Final design includes an HTML form and a confirmation page.
- [x] Final design sketches are sufficient to begin implementation; planning is complete.

> What did the student do well?

Nice job on incorporating both audiences into your final sketches and for flushign out the needs of your second target audience. 

> What needs improvement?

Because your original target audience is too general (anyone who wishes to donate), your second audiences seems to overlap with the first. Restricting your first audience (to perhaps to be possible volunteers or individuals) will make this distinction more clear. Additionally, you should justify/explain how this secondary audience will differ from the first. 


**Refined Dynamic Site 5 / 5 points** _(no partial credit)_


## Design Process / Evolution
- [x] Design process and design evolution are thoroughly documented in design journey.
- [x] Communicates the student's reasoning and thoughts behind their design decisions. Design Journey does not just state what they did.
- [x] Responses are thorough and thoughtful. Writing is clear and concise.
- [ ] Card sorting is clearly and thoroughly documented with photographic evidence.
- [x] Sketches are hand-drawn (ideally on paper) and are **not** wireframes or mockups.
- [ ] Justification is included under each sketch.
- [x] Design journey images are inside of the "documents" folder.

> What did the student do well?

For the most part, great job with communicating your reasoning and showing your design process.

> What needs improvement?

It seems as if your second iteration and third iteration of the card sorting has the same image. Make sure to show how you plan to organize your content for both audiences on one site in the final picture. Additionally, make sure to justify your changes to the site design in the final sketches portion.

**Design Process: 5 / 5 points** _(no partial credit)_


## Partials
- [x] At least 2 partials (includes nav bar) must be included on every page.
- [] Partial plan is sufficient to begin implementation.

> What did the student do well?

Nice job deciding on 2 partials

> What needs improvement?

You should further flush out what will be in each partial. What will be in the footer partial?

**Partials: 2 / 2 points** _(no partial credit)_


## Overall

- [x] Student made good progress with their project 1.
- [x] Student does not have outstanding issues that will severely limit our ability to grade their final submission.
    (i.e. missing files, no images in markdown preview, etc.)

> Does the student appear to be on track?

Yes! A few refinements here and there and all should be good! Don't forget to update your final sketches to include confirmation page designs. 

> Do you have any additional feedback for the student?

N/A
