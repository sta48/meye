  - ... etc.
- Need #3: ...
  - ...
- etc.


### Existing Site: Design/Sketches (Milestone 1)
> Sketch your existing site. Include these sketches here.
> DO NOT COPY SKETCHES FROM THE ORIGINAL ASSIGNMENT! Create new sketches here. This is part of the design process to get you thinking about the strengths/weaknesses of the current design.
> Provide a brief explanation _underneath_ each sketch.



### Refined Site: Target Audience II (Milestone 1)
> Who is your additional/secondary target audience?


### Refined Site: Target Audience II Needs (Milestone 1)

- Need #1: [Brief Title]
  - **Need**
    - > What does your target audience II need?
  - **Design Ideas and Choices**
    - > How will you refine your site's design to meet this need?

> Organize the content for the target audience and identify possible pages for the content using card sorting.

> Second, organize the content for target audience II. Document your card sorting by taking a photo and including it here.


> Next, organize the content for both target audiences. Document your card sorting by taking a photo and including it here.

- (Example) Home
- (Example) Admissions
- ...
- ...


### Refined Site: Design (Milestone 1)
> Refine the design of your site to meet the needs of _both_ target audiences.
> Include sketches of each page of the refined design.
> Provide a brief explanation _underneath_ each sketch.
> Document your _entire_ design process. **Show your preliminary sketches and your final sketches.**
> Don't forget the form and confirmation page!


### Partial Plan (Milestone 1)
> Using your refined sketches, plan your site's partials.
> You may describe each partial or sketch it. It's up to you!

## Sticky Form Planning (Milestone 2)

### Sticky Form (Milestone 2)
> What controls do you need for your form?


> Plan out your feedback messages for your form. You may sketch (probably the easiest) or write it out.


> How does this form meet the needs of at least one of your target audiences (specify which)?


### Validation Code Plan (Milestone 2)
> Write out your pseudocode plan for handling the validation of the form.

```
WRITE YOUR PSEUDOCODE HERE
```

## Complete & Polished Website (Final Submission)

### Target Audiences (Final Submission)
> Tell us how your final site meets the needs of the target audiences. Be specific here. Tell us how you tailored your design, content, etc. to make your website usable by both target audiences.


### Additional Design Justifications (Final Submission)
> If you feel like you haven’t fully explained your design choices in the final submission, or you want to explain some functions in your site (e.g., if you feel like you make a special design choice which might not meet the final requirement), you can use the additional design justifications to justify your design choices. Remember, this is place for you to justify your design choices which you haven’t covered in the design journey. You don’t need to fill out this section if you think all design choices have been well explained in the design journey.


### Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment. How have you improved from 1300? What things did you have trouble with?
